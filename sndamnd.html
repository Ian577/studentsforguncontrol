        The second ammendment: part of the Bill or Rights was ratified on December 15, 1791. 
        It ensures the right of all Americans to bear arms; to posess weapons to 
        protect themselves their rights and their property.

            more strict beackground cheks do not violate the second amendment because they do not

              As an effort to end gun violence, in 2023 the Biden administration established the 
              White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention. One of the offices main efforts was the 
              Bipartisan Safer Communities Act which aims to lower gun violence by increasing the 
              Federal age limit to buy a gun to 21, improving access to mental health, especialy for 
              young adults, and granting new authorities to the Justice Department to prosecute 
              firearm traffickers. The organization is still calling for congress to require safe 
              storage of firearms, requiring stricter background checks for all gun sales, eliminating 
              gun manufacturers immunity from liability, and enacting a ban on assault weapons with a 
              high capacity.
